Developing Data Products - Peer Assesment Projects
======================

### Shiny Application

You can access my app here: https://crazyfarang.shinyapps.io/BMIApp/

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github
The application must include the following:

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.  

### Reproducible Pitch Presentation

**BMIPitch Repository** http://crazyfarang.github.io/BMIPitch/index.html

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide)  to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify with an html5 slide deck.

Here's what you need

5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify
Your presentation pushed to github
A link to your github presentation pasted into the text box below
Your presentation must satisfy the following

It must be done in Slidify
It must be 5 pages
It must be on github
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line). 

http://slidify.org/publish.html
You can also do it manually, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ though remember the slidify publish command takes care of this for you if you'd like.
